Projects
========

Cinesite
--------

The following projects are part of the Maya pipeline.

- **Shotgun Entity Wrapper**: A library to wrap the Shotgun entities into a simple and easy to use interface that supports per session and per user caching.
- **Shot Publishing**: The main tool to publish shot data from departments such as Animation and Layout for upstream department use.
- **Scene Assembly**: A library to bundle a scene's hierarchy into a format that supports viewing the saved scene as well as importing back into Maya. This also comes with a tool to easily swap between different versions of the same scene or different assemblies.
- **Rig Mesh Simplification**: A tool to allow riggers to easily slice meshes for low quality rig representations. This allows for fast animation feedback.
- **Application Launcher**: A tool to launch instances of applications in an environment appropriate for a project.

DHX Media
---------

The following projects are part of the Maya and Nuke pipeline.

- **Path Template API**: The system to query paths for a specific entity in the pipeline.
- **Workspace Builder API**: The system to build the file structure for a specific entity.
- **Scene Saving**: A user interface to save scenes in Maya or Nuke.
- **Maya Node Framework**: An API to query an asset in a Maya scene, and a layer on top of the Maya API for nodes.
- **Asset Checks**: A framework and user interface to verify the quality of an asset for publishing.
- **Publishing Framework**: A framework and user interface for publishing assets and shots to be used in other stages of the pipeline.
- **Texture Framework**: An API to query and modify texture nodes and texture paths in a Maya asset.
- **Alembic Import/Export API**: An API to read and write Alembic point cache.
- **Animation Import/Export API**: An API to read and write animation data to a proprietary file format.
- **nCache Import/Export API**: An API to read and write nCache (Maya's particle and fluid cache format) files.
- **Sequence Shot Splitter**: A user interface to split a Maya sequence into a series of shots with assets.
- **EDL Splitter**: An API to split EDL files into a series of shots.
- **Shot Assembly**: An API and user interface to assemble assets and animation data into a shot.
- **Shot Cache**: A user interface to save the animation data for assets in a shot.
- **Farm Submission**: A user interface to submit Nuke render jobs to the farm.
- **Nuke Element Importer**: A user interface to import elements such as image sequences into a Nuke script.
- **Review Submission**: A user interface and framework to create and submit review items to supervisors and clients.
