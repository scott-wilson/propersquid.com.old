Hi! My name is Scott Wilson, and I am a Pipeline TD in Vancouver. I enjoy programming, and developing tools that help artists create. I am a huge supporter of open source software, contributing to projects where I can. (This website is released under the Apache 2.0 licence. Fork it [here](https://github.com/scott-wilson/propersquid.com).)

I am very fluent in Python, and have a moderate knowledge of C++, Rust and Go(lang). If you have any coding questions, I'm always happy to help.

If there are any problems with the website, feel free to create an issue or pull request on GitHub.
