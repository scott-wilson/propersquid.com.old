Here's a list of useful programming and CG resources I have found on the internet. This list may get updated in the future.

# Go
- https://awesome-go.com/ A collection of packages for Go.

# Python
- https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ A really good tool for testing in multiple environments. For example, having code that is guaranteed to work in Python 2.7, 3.x, Maya, Nuke, Houdini, etc.
- https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/ This makes writing unit tests a lot simpler. I may do a post on writing tests with my "testing trifecta".
- https://hypothesis.works/ Oh boy. This is a great testing tool. It is a property based testing framework that lets you slam your code with a bunch of random data to verify if it works or not. Whenever I write Python tests, I use this library first to get 100% coverage (or as close as I can to), then use regular unit tests to fill in the gaps or cover known breaks.

# Photogrammetry and Texture Generation
- http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/RTI/ I haven't experimented with this a lot, but it is a way to capture surface information (such as information used for normal maps) using a series of images of the same surface with different lighting conditions.
- https://mediatech.aalto.fi/publications/graphics/TwoShotSVBRDF/ Related to the above link.
- https://lesterbanks.com/2015/12/building-your-own-portable-pbr-texture-scanner/ A rig for capturing images for photorealistic textures.
- http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JosephAzzam/20160824/278719/The_Workflows_of_Creating_Game_Ready_Textures_and_Assets_using_Photogrammetry.php A guide on creating photogrammetry assets for games.
- http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JosephAzzam/20170110/288899/Everything_You_Need_to_Know_about_Photogrammetry_I_hope.php More useful information on photogrammetry.
