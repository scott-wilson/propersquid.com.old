Hello world! I've decided to switch my website from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) because I like the idea of Hugo's one app to do everything, and not have to worry about Ruby dependencies. I may play around with the stylesheet a bit, but I'd like to give a huge thanks to the [Minimal Hugo theme](https://github.com/calintat/minimal/) for coming up with the theme. It looks great.
