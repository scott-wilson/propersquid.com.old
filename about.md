Hi! My name is Scott Wilson, and I am a Pipeline TD at DHX Media in Vancouver. I enjoy programming, and developing tools that help artists create beautiful art. I am a huge supporter of open source software, contributing to projects where I can. (This website is released under the Apache 2.0 licence. Fork it [here](https://github.com/scott-wilson/propersquid.com).)

I am very fluent in Python, and have a basic knowledge of C++. If you have any coding questions, I'm always happy to help.

If there are any problems with the website, feel free to create an issue or pull request on GitHub.
